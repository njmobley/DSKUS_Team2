We made two datafram with SouthEast Asia's harvested area and agriculture yield data.
We want to see the data with 'Year' column to find changes in every year of each area and item.
We can see that Indonesia have the largest harvested area in the SouthEastern Asia.
Lao People's Democretic Repubilc Brunei Darussalam, Singapore and Timor-Leste have less harvested area relatively.
In the df_yield_plot, we can find that Banana, Cassava, Papayas, Pinapples, Sugar cane and Tomatoes made the largest yield in the SouthEastern Asia.
However, the gaps between each areas and crops are so large that it seems that outliers should be removed from this analysis.
