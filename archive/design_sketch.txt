climate data:
	- surface temperature
	- monthly 
	- aggregate by country (hopefully somebody has done this)

PsudeoCode:

1. Collect individual files
	- Collect climate data from NASA AgMERRA
	- Unemployment data from
	- Migration data from International Migrants Stcok Data
	- Food insecurity data from GFSI
	- Crop production data from FAOSTAT
2. Store them in collective repository (GitHub)
3. Make ("borrow") Simulation for food insecurity indicators:
	- Make Climate Simulator
	- Crop Production Simulator (what will happen in future climate conditions)
	- Migration Simulator
	- Unemployment Simulator
4. Train predictive model with Food Insecurity as response and simulated variables as features
5. Stored trained models into GitHub (Pickle)
6. Create website to display visualizations and provide users ability to see global effects on counterfactuals. 
(i.e what happens to a certain country if the temperatures rise 5 degrees instead of 10)
	- Create website using FIMS system
	  (reffering G. Nica-Avram et al,.(2020), FIMS: Identifying, Predicting and Visualising Food Insecurity.)
