climate data:
	- surface temperature
	- monthly 
	- aggregate by country (hopefully somebody has done this)

PsudeoCode:

1. Collect individual files
2. Store them in collective repository
3. Make ("borrow") Simulation for food insecurity indicators:
	- Climate Simulator
	- Make Crop Production Simulator (what will happen in future climate conditions)
	- Migration Simulator
	- Unemployment Simulator
4. Train predictive model with Food Insecurity as response and
simulated variables as features
5. Stored trained models into GitHub (Pickle)
6. Create website to display visualizations and provide users
ability to see global effects on counterfactuals. 
(i.e what happens to a certain country if the temperatures rise 5 degrees
instead of 10)
